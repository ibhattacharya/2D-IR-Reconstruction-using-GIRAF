    Abstract = {We address the problem of parameter estimation of an ellipse from a limited number of samples. We develop a new approach for solving the ellipse fitting problem by showing that the x and y coordinate functions of an ellipse are finite-rate-of-innovation (FRI) signals. Uniform samples of x and y coordinate functions of the ellipse are modeled as a sum of weighted complex exponentials, for which we propose an efficient annihilating filter technique to estimate the ellipse parameters from the samples. The FRI framework allows for estimating the ellipse parameters reliably from partial or incomplete measurements even in the presence of noise. The efficiency and robustness of the proposed method is compared with state-of-art direct method. The experimental results show that the estimated parameters have lesser bias compared with the direct method and the estimation error is reduced by 5-10 dB relative to the direct method.},

@article{6671478,
    Abstract = {In this paper, we extend the theory of sampling signals with finite rate of innovation (FRI) to a specific class of two-dimensional curves, which are defined implicitly as the zeros of a mask function. Here the mask function has a parametric representation as a weighted summation of a finite number of complex exponentials, and therefore, has finite rate of innovation . An associated edge image, which is discontinuous on the predefined parametric curve, is proved to satisfy a set of linear annihilation equations. We show that it is possible to reconstruct the parameters of the curve (i.e., to detect the exact edge positions in the continuous domain) based on the annihilation equations. Robust reconstruction algorithms are also developed to cope with scenarios with model mismatch. Moreover, the annihilation equations that characterize the curve are linear constraints that can be easily exploited in optimization problems for further image processing (e.g., image up-sampling). We demonstrate one potential application of the annihilation algorithm with examples in edge-preserving interpolation. Experimental results with both synthetic curves as well as edges of natural images clearly show the effectiveness of the annihilation constraint in preserving sharp edges, and improving SNRs.},

@article{1164949,
    Abstract = {A unified framework for the exact maximum likelihood estimation of the parameters of superimposed exponential signals in noise, encompassing both the time series and the array problems, is presented. An exact expression for the ML criterion is derived in terms of the linear prediction polynomial of the signal, and an iterative algorithm for the maximization of this criterion is presented. The algorithm is equally applicable in the case of signal coherence in the array problem. Simulation shows the estimator to be capable of providing more accurate frequency estimates than currently existing techniques. The algorithm is similar to those independently derived by Kumaresan et al. In addition to its practical value, the present formulation is used to interpret previous methods such as Prony's, Pisarenko's, and modifications thereof.},

@article{Jacob:2006p2612,
    Abstract = {We introduce a three-dimensional (3-D) parametric active contour algorithm for the shape estimation of DNA molecules from stereo cryo-electron micrographs. We estimate the shape by matching the projections of a 3-D global shape model with the micrographs; we choose the global model as a 3-D filament with a B-spline skeleton and a specified radial profile. The active contour algorithm iteratively updates the B-spline coefficients, which requires us to evaluate the projections and match them with the micrographs at every iteration. Since the evaluation of the projections of the global model is computationally expensive, we propose a fast algorithm based on locally approximating it by elongated blob-like templates. We introduce the concept of projection-steerability and derive a projection-steerable elongated template. Since the two-dimensional projections of such a blob at any 3-D orientation can be expressed as a linear combination of a few basis functions, matching the projections of such a 3-D template involves evaluating a weighted sum of inner products between the basis functions and the micrographs. The weights are simple functions of the 3-D orientation and the inner-products are evaluated efficiently by separable filtering. We choose an internal energy term that penalizes the average curvature magnitude. Since the exact length of the DNA molecule is known a priori, we introduce a constraint energy term that forces the curve to have this specified length. The sum of these energies along with the image energy derived from the matching process is minimized using the conjugate gradients algorithm. We validate the algorithm using real, as well as simulated, data and show that it performs well.},

@article{Jacob:2007p2609,
    Abstract = {Model-based techniques have the potential to reduce the artifacts and improve resolution in magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging, without sacrificing the signal-to-noise ratio. However, the current approaches have a few drawbacks that limit their performance in practical applications. Specifically, the classical schemes use less flexible image models that lead to model misfit, thus resulting in artifacts. Moreover, the performance of the current approaches is negatively affected by the magnetic field inhomogeneity and spatial mismatch between the anatomical references and spectroscopic imaging data. In this paper, we propose efficient solutions to overcome these problems. We introduce a more flexible image model that represents the signal as a linear combination of compartmental and local basis functions. The former set represents the signal variations within the compartments, while the latter captures the local perturbations resulting from lesions or segmentation errors. Since the combined set is redundant, we obtain the reconstructions using sparsity penalized optimization. To compensate for the artifacts resulting from field inhomogeneity, we estimate the field map using alternate scans and use it in the reconstruction. We model the spatial mismatch as an affine transformation, whose parameters are estimated from the spectroscopy data.},

    Abstract = {We propose a general approach for the design of 2D feature detectors from a class of steerable functions based on the optimization of a Canny-like criterion. In contrast with previous computational designs, our approach is truly 2D and provides filters that have closed-form expressions. It also yields operators that have a better orientation selectivity than the classical gradient or Hessian-based detectors. We illustrate the method with the design of operators for edge and ridge detection. We present some experimental results that demonstrate the performance improvement of these new feature detectors. We propose computationally efficient local optimization algorithms for the estimation of feature orientation. We also introduce the notion of shape-adaptable feature detection and use it for the detection of image corners.},

@article{Jacob:2004p2614,
    Abstract = {Parametric active contour models are one of the preferred approaches for image segmentation because of their computational efficiency and simplicity. However, they have a few drawbacks which limit their performance. In this paper, we identify some of these problems and propose efficient solutions to get around them. The widely-used gradient magnitude-based energy is parameter dependent; its use will negatively affect the parametrization of the curve and, consequently, its stiffness. Hence, we introduce a new edge-based energy that is independent of the parameterization. It is also more robust since it takes into account the gradient direction as well. We express this energy term as a surface integral, thus unifying it naturally with the region-based schemes. The unified framework enables the user to tune the image energy to the application at hand. We show that parametric snakes can guarantee low curvature curves, but only if they are described in the curvilinear abscissa. Since normal curve evolution do not ensure constant arc-length, we propose a new internal energy term that will force this configuration. The curve evolution can sometimes give rise to closed loops in the contour, which will adversely interfere with the optimization algorithm. We propose a curve evolution scheme that prevents this condition.},

    Abstract = {We introduce a non-iterative algorithm for the decomposition of fat and water from three point Dixon images. We adapt the harmonic retrieval framework to obtain the magnetic field-map as the common root of two polynomial equations; an algebraic scheme is used to solve for the field-map. To account for pixels with multiple solutions due to model mismatch, we introduce a model order estimation step. Aided by the estimate of the model order, our algorithm provides a set of feasible solutions at these pixels. We then use the prior information of the smoothness of the field-map to choose the correct solution from the set. The proposed algorithm is flexible enough to be applied to arbitrary sampling patterns and any number of metabolites. In contrast to iterative schemes that assume a single solution, the proposed scheme is not prone to ambiguous estimates due to local minima and model mismatch. This makes the algorithm applicable challenging situations, where the magnetic field is very inhomogeneous. We validate the algorithm with both phantom and human data ER  -},

    Abstract = {Magnetic resonance spectroscopy imaging (MRSI) is an attractive tool for medical imaging. However, its practical use is often limited by the intrinsic low spatial resolution and long acquisition time. Spectral localization by imaging (SLIM) has been proposed as a non-Fourier reconstruction algorithm that incorporates spatial a priori information about spectroscopically uniform compartments. Unfortunately, the influence of the magnetic field inhomogeneity--in particular, the susceptibility effects at tissues' boundaries--undermines the validity of the compartmental model. Therefore, we propose BSLIM as an extension of SLIM with field inhomogeneity compensation. A B0-field inhomogeneity map, which can be acquired rapidly and at high resolution, is used by the new algorithm as additional a priori information. We show that the proposed method is distinct from the generalized SLIM (GSLIM) framework. Experimental results of a two-compartment phantom demonstrate the feasibility of the method and the importance of inhomogeneity compensation.},
